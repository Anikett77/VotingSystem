# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based application that ensures transparency, fairness, and security in the voting process. It allows the election organizer to add candidates, and users can cast votes securely without duplication or manipulation.

## Project Vision
To build a trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof voting mechanism powered by blockchain technology, eliminating the risks of centralized control and fraud.

## Key Features
- Add candidates dynamically by the contract owner.
- One-person-one-vote enforced via blockchain.
- Anyone can verify votes and election results on-chain.
- Winner is automatically determined based on vote counts.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) for voter authentication.
- Expanding to support multiple elections in one contract.
- Off-chain front-end for easy user interaction.
- Enabling ranked-choice voting or weighted votes.
